Go for Pythonists
========================

This is a presentation that was given on [March 7, 2012](http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/events/103304362/) at the [New York Python Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/).

The presentation is stored in an odp file, which should be compatible with Libreoffice, PowerPoint, Keynote, etc. If there are any problems, let me know.
